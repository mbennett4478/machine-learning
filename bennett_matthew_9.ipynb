    "\n",
    "For the assignment you will have to use cross-validation to get an estimate of a model’s generalization performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will write a function to plot the training and validation root mean square error (rmse) values of the data matrix X for various polynomial degree starting from 1 up to the value set by max polynomial degree. It takes the data matrix X (usually the training data matrix) and the max polynomial degree; and for each polynomial degree it will augment the data matrix, then use k-fold cross-validation to compute the average mse for both the training and the validation fold. For training the model (using the “fit” method) it will use the model parameters from the function argument. Finally, the function will plot the root-mean-square error (rmse) values for the training and validation folds for each degree of the data matrix starting from 1 up to the max polynomial degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model's Complexity: Overfitting or Underfitting\n",
    "If a model performs well on the training data but generalizes poorly (on the validation data) according to the cross-validation metrics, then your model is overfitting. If it performs poorly on both, then it is underfitting. This is one way to tell when a model is too simple or too complex."
